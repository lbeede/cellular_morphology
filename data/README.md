# How to download our dataset

This repository contains a lightweight Python script to download a subset of the JUMP Cell Painting dataset used for single-cell morphological analysis.

---

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lbeede/cellular_morphology
cd cellular_morphology
```
Now we are in the repository directory.

2. Run download_data.py
```bash
python download_data.py
```

3. Done!
You now will have all the data from our project in cellular_morphology/data/cellmorph/. The files are as follow
- lmb_downsampled_data/ : folder containing all images and masks (.tiff)
  - Masks/ : folder containing the masks (.tiff)
- segmented/ : folder containing the segementations of the images
- all_features.npy : all the features of the segmented images
- all_treatments.npy : all the treatments of the segmented images
- metadata_BR00116991.csv : the images' corresponding metadata
You can now run the corresponding notebooks!

## Notes:
download_data.py is fully written by ChatGPT. I wanted to see if I could connect the data from my Google Drive to my GitHub without directly needing to download the files because it is a large zip, and it successfully worked! However, if the code does not work according to plan, please use this link (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s7N1JTEgNZ3UrBR2Kc3NPLPyBXZXYssB/view?usp=sharing) to access the zip file. You can only access the file through your LionMail account.
